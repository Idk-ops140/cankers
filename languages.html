            <p>
                Canker sores have different names in various languages and regions. For example, in Spanish, they are often referred to as "Ãºlceras bucales" or "aftas," while in French, they are called "aphtes." In Italian, the term "ulcera aftosa" is used. Despite the linguistic differences, the pain and discomfort caused by these sores are universally understood. While treatments may vary from one country to another, the focus remains on soothing the pain, promoting healing, and preventing recurrence. Knowing the different terms for canker sores in various languages can help in understanding and addressing them in global medical contexts.
