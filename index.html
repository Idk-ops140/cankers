            <h2>About Canker Sores</h2>
            <p>
                Canker sores, also known as aphthous ulcers, are small, painful lesions that form inside the mouth. They usually appear on the inner surfaces of the lips, cheeks, tongue, or at the base of the gums. These sores are typically round or oval with a white or yellow center and a red border. Canker sores can be extremely uncomfortable, especially when eating, drinking, or talking, and they can make oral hygiene difficult. The exact cause of canker sores is not fully understood, but factors such as stress, injury to the mouth, certain foods, hormonal changes, and even genetics are thought to contribute to their development. They are not contagious, so you can't catch them from someone else. Most canker sores heal on their own within 1 to 2 weeks, but there are treatments available to help alleviate the pain and discomfort associated with them. Over-the-counter ointments, mouthwashes, or oral medications can provide relief, and avoiding spicy or acidic foods may also reduce irritation. Severe or recurring cases of canker sores may require medical attention to rule out underlying health conditions.
